# Electronic-Fuse: 
This project focuses on developing an Electronic Fuse, an advanced electrical safety device designed to safeguard circuits against overcurrent scenarios. Unlike traditional fuses, this electronic alternative reroutes excessive current through an alternative path, protecting the load from damage. Key features include:

Working Principle: The fuse uses an Op-Amp as a comparator to monitor voltage levels. When voltage exceeds a safe limit, a relay redirects the current to an alternative path featuring an LED indicator, signaling an overcurrent condition. A built-in delay mechanism prevents premature activation during transient states.
Design Highlights: A step-down transformer, bridge rectifier, and potentiometer were utilized to simulate and regulate load conditions. The circuit includes BJTs to achieve a delayed response, enhancing operational reliability.
Applications and Benefits: The device is entirely automatic, eliminating the need for manual fuse replacement and enhancing the longevity of connected devices. This innovation addresses inconsistencies in power supply and ensures continuous protection.
