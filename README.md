# Electronic-Fuse: 


**Working Principle**:  
The fuse uses an Op-Amp as a comparator to monitor voltage levels. When voltage exceeds a safe limit, a relay redirects the current to an alternative path featuring an LED indicator, signaling an overcurrent condition. A built-in delay mechanism prevents premature activation during transient states.  

**Design Highlights**:  
- A step-down transformer, bridge rectifier, and potentiometer were utilized to simulate and regulate load conditions.  
- The circuit includes BJTs to achieve a delayed response, enhancing operational reliability.  

**Applications and Benefits**:  
- The device is entirely automatic, eliminating the need for manual fuse replacement.  
- Enhances the longevity of connected devices.  
- Addresses inconsistencies in power supply and ensures continuous protection.
